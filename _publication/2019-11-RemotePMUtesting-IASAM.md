Enhanced automation and control requires advanced sensors in the smart electric power grid. Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) is one of the sensors with the fastest streaming data enabling advanced automation and control algorithms in the electric grid. After PMUs are initially tested, installed, and brought into service in the field, there are no established procedure for in-field calibration testing following the IEEE Synchrophasor Measurement Test Suite Specification (TSS). Hence, in-field remote testing of PMU is necessary to guarantee that PMU performs accurately when needed and are not affected with any software/hardware error that develops with time or hidden failure that was not captured before commissioning. This paper proposes a feasible architecture for in-field remote PMU testing using an FPGA platform and PPA software platform, as well as presents an architecture and accuracy requirement of a typical PMU calibrator. An algorithm implemented in the FPGA platform using a low-cost National Instrument compact RIO (NI-cRIO) is also proposed in this paper. The generated signal using the proposed method is demonstrated to be suitable for PMU static test cases. The accuracy of the proposed method and the in-built signal generation module of NI-cRIO is compared based on the frequency uncertainty and total harmonic distortion. The compliance results of a sample PMU for static test cases using the proposed method is also presented in this paper.
